AUTOCHAINTRADE APP

AutoChainTrade, a decentralised automotive trading platform that Where innovation meets tradition in the world of automotive ownership. We're not just another car trading platform; we're revolutionizing the way people buy, sell, and own cars through the power of Ordinal NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
 With the rise of blockchain technology, our platform utilizes Ordinal NFTs to offer a secure and transparent way to buy and sell vehicles.

 What are ordinals?
Ordinals stored on the BSV blockchain are designed to exist as long as anyone around the globe is willing to keep a copy of the blockchain. This creates a reliable backup and maintains the files’ integrity.

When an Ordinal is inscribed, the specifics of the date, time, and addresses involved are permanently recorded. This indelible timestamp is significant, especially in this age of AI and deep fakes, where verifying the authenticity of documents, images, and videos is paramount.

Ordinals on the BSV blockchain provide an accessible way to use as a timestamp server or a public database. It’s akin to having a global, ultra-secure hard drive at your disposal that you can access anytime, anywhere, through any device connected to the BSV blockchain. They offer problem-solving benefits for everyone—from individuals to businesses to governments. Individuals can use them to create, collect, and share unique digital art, music, and memories that will exist ‘forever.’

 Each vehicle on our platform is assigned a unique Ordinal NFT, providing verifiable ownership and provenance throughout its lifecycle.
When a car is listed for sale on AutoChainTrade, the corresponding Ordinal NFT is transferred to the new owner upon purchase. This process ensures that the transaction is secure and tamper-proof, giving both buyers and sellers peace of mind.

The project utilize OrdinalLock which allows an ordinal to be offered up for sale on a decentralized marketplace. These listings can be purchased by anyone who is able to pay the requested price. Listings can also be cancelled by the person who listed them.
